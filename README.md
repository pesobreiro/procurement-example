## Installation

1. Deploy all 3 processes: select the process in the **project explorer**, do a right click and select **Deploy**
1. Run the sample data initialization process once and remove it from the Portal (using administration view)
1. Deploy the two application pages: in the **project explorer**, select **Pages/Forms/Layouts**, select a page, do a right click and select **Deploy**. Do the same for the second page. You can read more about pages from the <a href="https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/7.9/pages">official documentation</a>.
1. Deploy the application: in the **project explorer**, select **Application descriptors**, select _Procurement_application.xml_, do a right click and select **Deploy**. You can read more about applications in the <a href="https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/7.9/applications">official documentation</a>.
10. Run the Procurement application by accessing to this URL (the port number may vary):<br/><a href="http://localhost:8080/bonita/apps/procurement">http://localhost:8080/bonita/apps/procurement</a>

The same user can fill a procurement request and approve it himself.
